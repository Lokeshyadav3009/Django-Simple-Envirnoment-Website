            Birds come under the class – vertebrates. Birds are basically warm blooded and they lay eggs. Since they have a high body temperature, they utilize lots of energy and hence they needs to keep eating all the time. The bodies of birds are covered with feathers which have mainly three functions. Feathers help them in their flight, helps them to have a regulated body temperature and in some cases is also for good display. Since the bones of birds are hollow and have air sacks, they are able to fly as it makes them lighter. Wings help them in their flight. Many species of birds are economically important as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing, with domesticated and undomesticated birds being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers. Songbirds, parrots, and other species are popular as pets. Guano (bird excrement) is harvested for use as a fertilizer. Birds figure throughout human culture. About 120 to 130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them. Recreational birdwatching is an important part of the ecotourism industry.

                Nature, in the broadest sense, is equivalent to the natural world, physical world, or material world. "Nature" refers to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. It ranges in scale from the subatomic to the cosmic.

                The term "nature" may refer to living plants and animals, geological processes, weather, and physics, such as matter and energy. The term is often refers to the "natural environment" or wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, beaches, and in general areas that have not been substantially altered by humans, or which persist despite human intervention. For, example, manufactured objects and human interaction are generally not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept of "nature" implies a distinction between natural and artificial elements of the Earth, with the artificial as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind.
                Our lives as human beings started on this planet Earth and since then we are exhausting its resources. But, in return, we are exposing it to the external threats of destruction and mistreatment. Due to this, beautiful forests have been destroyed, rivers have been polluted and vast open lands have been consumed for buildings and factories. We are giving challenges to nature by doing activities as hunting down animals, cutting down trees, releasing poisonous gases and polluting rivers.

            Flower is a modified shoot with condensed axis called thalamus and appendages called floral organs. Stamens and carpels represent the essential parts of a flower. Thus, flower is a shoot bearing sporophyll. Flowering plants have successfully colonized land by reducing the water dependent gametophytic generation to the point where it is entirely protected within the sporophyte’s generation.
            Typically, flower is a condensed branch in which internodes have become condensed, bringing the nodes close to one another, and the leaves are modified to form floral whorls that directly or indirectly participate in the process of reproduction. Flowers differ considerably in size, shape, color and arrangement of their parts, yet most of them bear a common structural plan.
            Flowers are symbolic of beauty, love and tranquility. They form the soul of a garden and convey the message of nature to man. Flowers and objects of aesthetic, ornamental, social, religious and cultural value.

            The Earth is home to many creatures. Animals have been the inhabitants of this planet, along with humans. Historically, animals were used for transportation, protection, as well as for hunting. Animals have been companions to man since time immemorial.
            Animals are the kingdom while classifying their species. There are a variety of species present under this, with their presence spanning across the world. Amphibians primarily require a moist environment as they breathe and absorb through thin skins. Some amphibians include frogs, salamanders, toads, and caecilians. Mammals are vertebrates and warm-blooded. Females have mammary glands to feed their young ones and have a thick coat of fur. Mammals include carnivores, bears, rodents, etc. Reptiles are vertebrates, but lay eggs. Some of them have scales. Common reptiles are lizards, turtles, and snakes.
            Insects have an exoskeleton. They have three pairs of legs, a head, thorax, and abdomen. Beetles, ants, and bees are some insects. Birds have wings, beaks, and feathers such as eagles, pigeons, crows, and sparrows. There are many species of animals that are domesticated as well, such as dogs, cats, rabbits, horses, etc.

            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed" style="text-align:justify">
                Global warming is a term used for the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and its related effects. Scientists are more than 95% certain that nearly all of global warming is caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other human-caused emissions.
                Within the earth's atmosphere, accumulating greenhouse gases like water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the gases within the atmosphere that absorb and emit heat radiation. Increasing or decreasing amounts of greenhouse gases within the atmosphere act to either hold in or release more of the heat from the sun.

                Our atmosphere is getting hotter, more turbulent, and more unpredictable because of the “boiling and churning” effect caused by the heat-trapping greenhouse gases within the upper layers of our atmosphere. With each increase of carbon, methane, or other greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere, our local weather and global climate is further agitated, heated, and “boiled.”

                Global warming is gauged by the increase in the average global temperature of the Earth. Along with our currently increasing average global temperature, some parts of the Earth may actually get colder while other parts get warmer—hence the idea of average global temperature. Greenhouse gas-caused atmospheric heating and agitation also increase the unpredictability of the weather and climate and dramatically increase the severity, scale, and frequency of storms, droughts, wildfires, and extreme temperatures.
